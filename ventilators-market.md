<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilators</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilator market is primarily divided into two types: positive pressure mechanical ventilators and negative pressure mechanical ventilators. Positive pressure ventilators deliver air into the lungs, assisting patients with breathing by creating pressure, making them essential in critical care settings. In contrast, negative pressure ventilators operate by creating a vacuum around the chest, allowing ambient air to flow into the lungs, commonly used for conditions like poliomyelitis or respiratory muscle weakness. Both types play vital roles in respiratory support.</p></p>
