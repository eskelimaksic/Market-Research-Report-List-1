<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lithotripter</li><li>Ultrasonic Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biliary lithotripter market includes mechanical and ultrasonic lithotripters, which are devices used to treat bile duct stones. Mechanical lithotripters utilize physical force, often through a basket or balloon, to fragment stones for easier removal. In contrast, ultrasonic lithotripters employ high-frequency sound waves to create oscillations that disintegrate stones into smaller, more manageable pieces. Both technologies aim to enhance the effectiveness of endoscopic procedures and minimize patient discomfort, but they differ in their methods and applications.</p></p>
